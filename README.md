# ApprentiCalc - Milestone Project 2

**A website providing a user friendly Minimum Off-The-Job Hours (MinimumOTJH) calculator for apprenticeship standards as per the Insitute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (IfATE) website and databse.**

## 1. Overview

Confused about minimum On-The-Job (OTJ) hours for your apprenticeship? ApprentiCalc is a simple and intuitive tool designed to quickly calculate the required minimum OTJ hours, helping apprentices and employers easily understand and track progress.

Navigating the requirements for apprenticeship On-The-Job (OTJ) hours can often feel complex and confusing. ApprentiCalc is designed to cut through the complexity and provide a clear, straightforward solution for both apprentices and employers. This intuitive online tool empowers users to quickly and accurately calculate the minimum OTJ hours mandated for their specific apprenticeship programme. By simplifying this crucial aspect of apprenticeship planning and management, ApprentiCalc helps ensure compliance with regulations and provides a transparent framework for tracking progress.

Whether you're an apprentice eager to understand your learning journey and milestones, or an employer striving to effectively manage and mentor your apprentices, ApprentiCalc offers a user-friendly platform to obtain the essential OTJ figures you need, saving you time and reducing the potential for errors.

## 2. Rationale

ApprentiCalc is an online tool developed to provide a straightforward and efficient means of calculating the minimum On-The-Job (OTJ) hours required for various apprenticeship programmes. Its primary objective is to simplify the process of understanding and determining these essential training requirements for both apprentices and employers.

The inspiration for ApprentiCalc arose from observing the often confusing and time-consuming nature of deciphering apprenticeship OTJ guidelines. Many individuals and organisations struggle to readily access and accurately calculate these figures, leading to potential misunderstandings, administrative burdens, and even non-compliance. This project aims to address this gap by providing a user-friendly and readily accessible solution.

Apprenticeships are a vital pathway for skills development and workforce training. A key component of any apprenticeship is the mandated On-The-Job training, which ensures practical experience alongside theoretical learning. However, the specific minimum hours required can vary significantly depending on the sector, level, and governing body of the apprenticeship. This variability often necessitates careful review of complex documentation and manual calculations, which can be prone to error and inefficient.

The core problem that ApprentiCalc seeks to resolve is the difficulty and inefficiency associated with determining the minimum required On-The-Job training hours for apprenticeships. This can lead to wasted time for administrators, potential misinterpretations of regulations, and uncertainty for apprentices regarding their training progress.

ApprentiCalc offers a user-friendly online platform where users can input relevant details about their apprenticeship (e.g., sector, level, duration). The tool will then automatically calculate and display the minimum required OTJ hours based on pre-loaded or easily configurable parameters. Key features include an intuitive interface, clear presentation of results, and the potential for future integration of specific apprenticeship frameworks. This approach provides a unique and accessible alternative to manual calculations and sifting through lengthy documents.

ApprentiCalc offers several advantages over current methods. It provides a significant time-saving for administrators and apprentices alike. The automated calculations reduce the risk of human error, ensuring greater accuracy and compliance. Furthermore, the clear and accessible output empowers apprentices to better understand their training requirements and track their progress effectively. For employers, it streamlines the management of apprenticeship programmes and aids in ensuring adherence to regulatory standards.

The initial scope of ApprentiCalc focuses on providing accurate calculations for a range of common apprenticeship frameworks. Acknowledged limitations include the need for ongoing updates to reflect changes in regulations and the potential initial focus on specific sectors. Potential future enhancements for ApprentiCalc include the integration of progress tracking features, the ability to save and export calculations, the inclusion of links to relevant regulatory documents, and the expansion to cover a wider range of apprenticeship frameworks and regions.

In summary, ApprentiCalc addresses a significant need by providing a user-friendly and accurate solution for calculating minimum apprenticeship On-The-Job training hours. By simplifying this process, the tool has the potential to save time, reduce errors, improve understanding, and ultimately contribute to the more effective management and successful completion of apprenticeships.

## 3. User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

### Design

- **Colour Scheme**

  As the project is based around apprenticeships and OTJ Calculations, the colours have been based on the Insitute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (IfATE) logo. The below colour palette was generated from the IfATE logo using [IMAGECOLORPICKER.com](https://imagecolorpicker.com/)

  ![Colour palette for this project](assets/readme/colour-palette.png)

- **Typography**

  The ["Merriweather Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather+Sans) font family has been selected as the main font used throughout the whole project with Sans Serif as the fallback font in any case that the font isn't being imported into the project correctly. Merriweather Sans is a classified as a variable font which allow one font file to contain multiple variations. You can change the weight, width, style, optical size, and more. The variables within variable fonts are controlled by axes.

  The ["Tauri"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tauri) font family has been selected as the heading element font. Tauri is classified as a static font and is not as versitile as a variable font, hence why this is used for heading elements only. Tauri is a semi condensed sans typeface with a sense of restraint, clarity and rigor. Tauri's unique qualities do not shout and instead emerge slowly and organically as it is used.

### Imagery

This website utilises a variety of images to enhance the user experience and convey information effectively. The images serve several purposes:

- **Branding:** The logo (`assets/images/logo.png`) is used in the navigation bar to reinforce brand identity and provide a consistent visual element throughout the site.

<!--- - **Homepage Carousel:** The carousel on the homepage (`assets/images/index-carousel-1.svg`, `assets/images/index-carousel-2.svg`, `assets/images/index-carousel-3.svg`, `assets/images/guide-carousel-2.svg`, `assets/images/guide-carousel-3.svg`, `assets/images/guide-carousel-4.svg`, `assets/images/guide-carousel-5.svg`) features rotating images with accompanying text to highlight key information, promotions, or calls to action. These images are designed to be visually appealing and informative.

- **Informational Images:** Images are incorporated within the accordion sections (`assets/images/esfa-2.jpg`, `assets/images/asf.jpg`) and card components (`assets/images/esfa.jpg`, `assets/images/career-search.jpg`, `assets/images/ncs.webp`, `assets/images/funding-grants.jpg`) to illustrate concepts, break up text, and make the content more engaging. These images are carefully selected to be relevant to the surrounding information. --->

- **Favicon:** A favicon (`assets/favicon/apple-icon.png`, `assets/favicon/favicon-32x32.png`, `assets/favicon/favicon-16x16.png`) is included to provide a visual cue for the website in browser tabs and bookmarks. This also provides a first look in to the brand of the website.

All images used on the website are optimised for web performance to ensure fast loading times and a smooth user experience. Alternative text (alt text) is provided for all images to ensure accessibility for users with visual impairments and to improve SEO. The alt text descriptions are concise and descriptive, accurately conveying the content and purpose of each image. <!--- For example, the carousel images have descriptive alt text explaining the message conveyed in each image. Similarly, the images in the accordion and card sections have alt text that describes the subject of the image. --->
