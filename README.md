## 2. User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

### Design

- **Colour Scheme**

  As the project is based around apprenticeships and OTJ Calculations, the colours have been based on the Insitute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (IfATE) logo. The below colour palette was generated from the IfATE logo using [IMAGECOLORPICKER.com](https://imagecolorpicker.com/)

- **Typography**

  The ["Merriweather Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather+Sans) font family has been selected as the main font used throughout the whole project with Sans Serif as the fallback font in any case that the font isn't being imported into the project correctly. Merriweather Sans is a classified as a variable font which allow one font file to contain multiple variations. You can change the weight, width, style, optical size, and more. The variables within variable fonts are controlled by axes.

  The ["Tauri"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tauri) font family has been selected as the heading element font. Tauri is classified as a static font and is not as versitile as a variable font, hence why this is used for heading elements only. Tauri is a semi condensed sans typeface with a sense of restraint, clarity and rigor. Tauri's unique qualities do not shout and instead emerge slowly and organically as it is used.

### Imagery

This website utilises a variety of images to enhance the user experience and convey information effectively. The images serve several purposes:

- **Branding:** The logo (`assets/images/logo.png`) is used in the navigation bar to reinforce brand identity and provide a consistent visual element throughout the site.

<!--- - **Homepage Carousel:** The carousel on the homepage (`assets/images/index-carousel-1.svg`, `assets/images/index-carousel-2.svg`, `assets/images/index-carousel-3.svg`, `assets/images/guide-carousel-2.svg`, `assets/images/guide-carousel-3.svg`, `assets/images/guide-carousel-4.svg`, `assets/images/guide-carousel-5.svg`) features rotating images with accompanying text to highlight key information, promotions, or calls to action. These images are designed to be visually appealing and informative.

- **Informational Images:** Images are incorporated within the accordion sections (`assets/images/esfa-2.jpg`, `assets/images/asf.jpg`) and card components (`assets/images/esfa.jpg`, `assets/images/career-search.jpg`, `assets/images/ncs.webp`, `assets/images/funding-grants.jpg`) to illustrate concepts, break up text, and make the content more engaging. These images are carefully selected to be relevant to the surrounding information. --->

- **Favicon:** A favicon (`assets/favicon/apple-icon.png`, `assets/favicon/favicon-32x32.png`, `assets/favicon/favicon-16x16.png`) is included to provide a visual cue for the website in browser tabs and bookmarks. This also provides a first look in to the brand of the website.

All images used on the website are optimised for web performance to ensure fast loading times and a smooth user experience. Alternative text (alt text) is provided for all images to ensure accessibility for users with visual impairments and to improve SEO. The alt text descriptions are concise and descriptive, accurately conveying the content and purpose of each image. <!--- For example, the carousel images have descriptive alt text explaining the message conveyed in each image. Similarly, the images in the accordion and card sections have alt text that describes the subject of the image. --->
